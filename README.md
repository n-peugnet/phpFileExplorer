# PHP file explorer

This is a minimalist yet functionnal file explorer to list and open files and folders in a browser.
If you are going to put this on a public directory you should consider adding a password and/or carefully choose your root directory path.

## How to use it

Just rename `./includes/sampleconfig.php` to `./includes/config.php` and change the path of the root directory you want to explore
